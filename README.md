-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   A minimal but clean colour scheme used with just two main colours being black and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The striking Bebas Neue typeface works really well with conserative Montserrat; used for the main body of the website. The difference in style creates a clean modern look and feel. Both typefaces have a fallback of sans-serif incase of any import issues.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The first thing you see is the background hero image and horizontal tag line, designed to stun the vistor's attention and draw them in to see what is on offer.
        - The use of opacity and imagery increases the clean and consise theme of the website but still informing the user of the options available.

-   ### Wireframes

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    Q1. As a first time vistor, I want a clear understanding of the purpose of the website.

        -   As soon as users enter the site, they are drawn to the hero image spread across the width of the screen with the tag line offer.
        -   Scrolling down there is a clear message showing what services are available from the use of clipped images and opacity captions.
        -   The about section is presented cleanly, split into three sections with a nice use of icons around the qualifications. 
        -   Immediately the use of shadow around the testimonial boxes stands out. A simple name and quote layout works well.
        -   Again the subtle use of opcaity is the driving force behind the contact page with the main form standing out in white. The change of colour on hover is a nice touch epsically on the submit button.

    Q2. As a first time vistor, I want a consise description of the fitness goals this personal trainer concentrates on.

        -   This is very easy to see from the services section using the images and the short descriptions.
        -   The contact form also links to the services on offer with the 'Goal' dropdown.

    Q3. As a first time vistor, I want the feel comfortable with the content and imagery I am are viewing.

        -   There is no content from the site that would offend or make any user feel uncomfortable.

    Q4. As a first time vistor, I need to know where the company is based and how to get there.

        -   At the bottom of the site, there is a map spread across the whole screen showing the location of company. This also has the option to show directions using the in-built link which opens in a new tab.   

    Q5. As a first time vistor, I want to know about the personal trainer
        - What qualifications does he have?
        - How long has the personal trainer been working for?
        - Why should I book a session?

        -   The qualifications are clearly presented in the about section using the official titles and centred around dumbbel icons.
        -   The very first sentence gives the users confidence based on the "over 15 years of personal training"
        -   The final paragraph provides a handy link to the contact form and provides the first piece of motivational text in order to use said contact form.

    Q6. As a first time vistor, can I trust this person? Have they been reviewed well by previous clients are they numerous testimonials for me to look at. Do they have a social media presence which is regularly updated and followed.

        -   All the testimonials posted are shown with first and seconds names and contain speech marks so that you know that they are direct quotes.
        -   Links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are found at the bottom of the website and open in a new tab when clicked. Keeping them on the page after the form has been submited increases the continuity.

## Credits

### Code

-   Navigation bar links to display futher down the page come from this post on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17534661/make-anchor-link-go-some-pixels-above-where-its-linked-to). The use of a sticky navigation bar was blocking the subheading for each section when the navigation links were used.


-   The testimonials page was created using Flexbox from [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). This was used to enable the tablet screen size (and smaller) to view the testimonials as a list and one column. 

### Content

-   All content was written by the developer.

### Media

-   All Images were sourced from google.

### Acknowledgements

-   My Mentor for answering my questions throughout.

-   Slack users for constructive feedback.
