-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   A minimal but clean colour scheme used with just two main colours being black and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The striking Bebas Neue typeface works really well with conserative Montserrat; used for the main body of the website. The difference in style creates a clean modern look and feel. Both typefaces have a fallback of sans-serif incase of any import issues.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The first thing you see is the background hero image and horizontal tag line, designed to stun the vistor's attention and draw them in to see what is on offer.
        - The use of opacity and imagery increases the clean and consise theme of the website but still informing the user of the options available.

    Q1. As a first time vistor, I want a clear understanding of the purpose of the website.

        Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    Q2. As a first time vistor, I want a consise description of the fitness goals this personal trainer concentrates on.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    Q3. As a first time vistor, I want the feel comfortable with the content and imagery I am are viewing.

        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

    Q4. As a first time vistor, I need to know where the company is based and how to get there.

        - What qualifications does he have?
        - How long has the personal trainer been working for?
        - Why should I book a session?
