-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   A minimal but clean colour scheme used with just two main colours being black and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The striking Bebas Neue typeface works really well with conserative Montserrat; used for the main body of the website. The difference in style creates a clean modern look and feel. Both typefaces have a fallback of sans-serif incase of any import issues.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The first thing you see is the background hero image and horizontal tag line, designed to stun the vistor's attention and draw them in to see what is on offer.
        - The use of opacity and imagery increases the clean and consise theme of the website but still informing the user of the options available.
